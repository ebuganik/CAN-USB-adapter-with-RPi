# Design and Implementation of a CAN-USB adapter using a Raspberry Pi device

## About the project
This repository is part of a practical project for an undergraduate thesis at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Banja Luka, majoring in electronics. The project aims to develop a device similar to PEAKCAN using a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi will receive and process CAN messages through a C++ application, then transmit them via an interface like USB to a PC, where they will be displayed using a Python application. Additionally, requests from the PC will be sent to read from the CAN bus and to transmit data onto the bus. 
**NOTE**: The repository is still under development.

## Raspberry Pi Setup and Hardware Interface Configuration
> Include the configuration of the Raspberry Pi device, covering both serial communication and connection to the hardware interface. Also, provide details on the connections used with the Raspberry Pi and the additional circuit designed for CAN communication.
## Launching the Applications
